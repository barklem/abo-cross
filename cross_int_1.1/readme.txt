README.TXT for getcross program package.

by Paul Barklem 

v1.0 January 1998
Program developed.

v1.1 December 1998.
Minor bug fixed in WIDTH (incorrect declaration of DGAMMA).  Parameter statements changed to standard form.

This package (cross.tar) should contain the following files:

dfdata.dat
getcross.f
pddata.dat
readme.txt
spdata.dat

The data (*.dat) files are the tables for each type of transition.
They are in a specific format which must not be changed.

The file getcross.f is the main fortran file containing
all the code necessary.
